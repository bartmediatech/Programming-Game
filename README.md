# Programming-game

This is a game I made in the Processing Environment. 
I made it as a final assignment for a programming course during my Master Degree. 
The game had to be intuitive, max 60 seconds and had to include user input with a mouse. 
Moreover, there had to be an outcome of either winning, or losing. 
The time left had to be made with something other than numbers. 
It was graded with a 9.5 (out of 10).
