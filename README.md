# Programming-game

This is a game I made in the Processing Environment. 
I made it as a final assignment for a programming course during my Master Degree. 
The game had to be intuitive, max 60 seconds and had to include user input with a mouse. 
Moreover, there had to be an outcome of either winning, or losing. 
The time left had to be made with something other than numbers. 
It was graded with a 9.5 (out of 10).

What is Processing? 

Processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.

Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.
